  <h1>Welcome to Cookin' on Rails</h1>

  <p>
    Who doesn't know this problem: the fridge is full, but you
    have no idea what to cook from all these ingredients?
  </p>
  <p><img src="<%= image_url("ingredients.jpg")%>" alt="der ominöse kühlschrank"></p>
  <p>
    This is where Cookin' on Rails can help you:<br>
  </p>
  <p>
    You can check all the ingredients you have at home
    and Cookin' on Rails searches the database for recipes you
    can cook from them.
    Or you can share you own recipes on this platform.
